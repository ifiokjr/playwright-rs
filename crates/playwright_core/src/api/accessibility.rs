/// The Accessibility class provides methods for inspecting Chromium's
/// accessibility tree. The accessibility tree is used by assistive technology such as [screen readers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screen_reader) or
/// [switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Switch_access).
///
/// Accessibility is a very platform-specific thing. On different platforms,
/// there are different screen readers that might have wildly different output.
///
/// Rendering engines of Chromium, Firefox and WebKit have a concept of
/// "accessibility tree", which is then translated into
/// different platform-specific APIs. Accessibility namespace gives access to
/// this Accessibility Tree.
///
/// Most of the accessibility tree gets filtered out when converting from
/// internal browser AX Tree to Platform-specific AX-Tree or by assistive
/// technologies themselves. By default, Playwright tries to approximate this
/// filtering, exposing only the "interesting" nodes of the tree.
